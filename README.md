Appication Icon
---------------

Bridge Height road sign image downloaded from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MUTCD_W12-2.svg). This image is in the public domain.

The SVG image from Wikipedia was then modified slightly. While the apparance of the image is the same, its XML was modified for clarity.

An altered copy of this image was created for use with Windows 8 tiles.

PNG and ICO files were generated from the SVG using [RealFaviconGenerator.net]. (See [related article](http://css-tricks.com/favicon-quiz/).)
